# Statistical Analysis of Identity Leadership vs. Pro-Environmental Behavior Intentions

This repository contains the data analysis for a bachelor thesis investigating the impact of identity leadership language on pro-environmental behavior intentions. The project explores various psychological scales and factors such as environmental concern, identification with humanity, and pro-environmental behavior intentions before and after exposure to identity leadership language.

## Description

The analysis focuses on examining the relationships and interactions between different variables using statistical methods, including correlation analysis, SEM, t-tests, and regression analysis. The study aims to test several hypotheses regarding the effect of leadership language on environmental behavior and the mediating and moderating roles of identification with humanity and environmental concern.

## Data

The dataset includes measures of pro-environmental behavior intentions, environmental concern, identification with humanity, and demographic variables. Participants were exposed to different scenarios with or without identity leadership language, and their responses were collected using standardized scales.

## Analysis

The analysis includes:

- Descriptive statistics to summarize the sample characteristics.
- Correlation analysis to examine the relationships between scales.
- Moderated regression to control for confounding variables and assess the impact of leadership language.
- T-tests to perform manipulation checks and assess differences in behavior intentions.
- Regression analysis to test mediation and moderation hypotheses.
- Structural Equation Modeling

## Assumption Checks

Prior to inferential testing, assumptions for each statistical test were verified:

- Normality was assessed using Shapiro-Wilk tests and Q-Q plots.
- Homogeneity of variances was checked using Levene's test.
- Multicollinearity was evaluated using Variance Inflation Factors (VIF).

## Results

The results section provides detailed findings from the statistical tests, including significant correlations, the effects of leadership language on behavior intentions, and the results of mediation and moderation analysis.

## Figures and Tables

Visual representations of the data and analysis results are provided in the form of figures and tables. These include boxplots, Q-Q plots, and bar charts representing the distribution of variables across the sample.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis, run the R scripts provided in the repository. Ensure all prerequisite R packages are installed.

## Contributions

Researchers and students interested in social/environmental psychology, statistical analysis in R, or replication studies are welcome to use the data and scripts for educational purposes, in line with the open science framework.
